# ProjectRTSA
Digital Crafts group project with Richard, Tiffany, Steve, and Audi.

Master branch is only for FINISHED and FULLY FUNCTION code. Incomplete Code branch is what we will be pushing to by default
once we are merging our codes. Until we are ready to merge codes, we each have our own branches to commit our work to.
