# ProjectSTAR
Digital Crafts group project with Richard, Tiffany, Steve, and Audi.

  Master branch is only for FINISHED and FULLY FUNCTION code. Incomplete Code branch is what we will be pushing to by default once we are merging our codes. Until we are ready to merge codes, we each have our own branches to commit our work to.

*****************************************************************************************************************************
  If git push origin <your branch> is running into issues, DO NOT DO git F push! You may completely overwrite or delete the master branch by accident.
  
  Go to the github.com website, go to your branch, and manually select the files to commit. It may be a little extra work, but it will overshadow the immense work we will lose if we accidentally delete everyone's work.
